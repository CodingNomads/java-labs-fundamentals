call to super the thread constructor + invoke start() method.

4) How do you get a thread's name?

7) What does the "sleep()" method do?

pause the execution of a thread by a specified time in milliseconds

8) What is the one method you must write if you're implementing the Runnable class?

9) Should you create that same method if you're extending Thread?

yes

10) Why is multi-threading so cool?

we can execute multiple tasks during idle time of other threads to increase the speed at which our program runs.
