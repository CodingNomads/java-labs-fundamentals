Answer the following questions:

*1) What is an array?

array is an object
a collection of data of the same datatype

*2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?

String[] cats = new String[9];

*3) What is a multidimensional array?

its a storage of arrays in an array
can be of uniform size or also non-uniform = irregular array


*4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?

int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

*5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?

String schatzl = dogs[9];

*6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?

Thrown to indicate that an array has been accessed with an illegal index.
The index is either negative or greater than or equal to the size of the array.


*7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from an int array.

for(int i = 1; i < array.length; i++)System.out.println(array[i]);


*8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?

Integer.MAX_VALUE - 5

Java has been criticized for not supporting arrays of more than 231âˆ’1 (about 2.1 billion) elements. This is a limitation of the language;
the Java Language Specification, Section 10.4, states that:

Arrays must be indexed by int values... An attempt to access an array component with a long index value results in a compile-time error.


*9) What is a bubble sort?

its an algorithm used to sort the elements of an array, through comparing them
performance is not so good though
it is a comparison sort


*10) How does a bubble sort work?

example for sorting integers in descending order

for (c = 0; c < ( n - 1 ); c++) {
      for (d = 0; d < n - c - 1; d++) {
        if (array[d] > array[d+1])
        {
          swap       = array[d];
          array[d]   = array[d+1];
          array[d+1] = swap;
          }}}
          works by repeatedly stepping through the list to be sorted, comparing each pair of adjacent items and
          swapping them if they are in the wrong order.

*11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?

for example an work year array with different workhours daily

*12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.

int[] array = new int[10];

for(int i : array){System.out.println(i);}

*13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.

while(int i < array.length){
System.out.println(array[i]);
}

*14) What is a queue?

The Java Queue interface, java.util.Queue represents a data structure.
The Java Queue interface is a subtype of the Java Collection interface. It represents an ordered sequence of objects just
like a Java List, but its intended use is slightly different.

*15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?

It is designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue,
and elements removed from the beginning of the queue.
This is similar to how a queue in a supermarket works.

*16) What is a stack?

a data structure, a stack class that extends Vector class

*17) What differentiates stacks and queues?

stacks: LIFO concept
queues: FIFO concept

*18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?

to populate or iterate through a multidimensional arrays

*19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?

The Java collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly
reusable collection data structures

*20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.

int[][] array = new int[5][6];

for(int i = 0; i < array.length; i++){
    for(int t = 0; t < array.length; t++){
         System.out.println(array[i][t]);
       }
    }

*21) What is a String?

a String is an object

*22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?

"".indexOf('x');
"".length();
"".equals("something");

*23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?

that they can not be changed after they have been created

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
