Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
An array is a collection of variables of the same type, referred to by a common name.

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
A multidimensional array is an array containing more than one arrays.

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
dogs[9];

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
This exception occurs when you try to access a index of the array that is greater than the size of the array.

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.


8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
Integer.MAX_VALUE - 5 (Integer.MAX_VALUE - 5 = 2^31-1 = 2147483647 )

9) What is a bubble sort?
Bubble sort is the simplest sorting alogorithm that works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.

10) How does a bubble sort work?
Given an array with random numbers in random order: (2 4 9 1 3)
2 moves to after 1: (4 9 1 2 3)
4 moves to pass 3: (9 1 2 3 4)
9 moves to pass 4: (1 2 3 4 9)

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
You use an irregular array when you want to create multidimensional arrays of non-uniform size.
For ex. use an int array to log the class grades of students who take different numbers of classes in a semester.

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
for(var i = 0; i < arrayName.length; i++){
}

OR
for(int i : arrayName){
}

13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
while(int i < array.length){
    system.out.println(array[i]);

14) What is a queue?
The Java queue interface represents a data structure designed to have elements inserted at the end of the queue,
and elements removed from the beginning of the queue, following the FILO model.

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
1. enqueue: to add an element to the end of a queue.
2. dequeue: to remove an element from the start of a queue.

16) What is a stack?
A stack is a collection of objects that is based on the LIFO concept.

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
Que is FILO; stack is LIFO.

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
When iterating through an array.

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
The collections framework is a unified architecture for representing and manipulating collections, enabling collections to be manipulated independently of implementation details.
It includes:
1. AbstractCollection
2. AbstractList
3. AbstractSequentialList
4. LinkedList
5. ArrayList
6. AbstractSet
7. HashSet
8. LinkedHashSet
9. TreeSet
10. AbstractMap
11. HashMap
12. TreeMap
13. WeakHashMap
14. LinkedHashMap
15. IdentityHashMap

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
1. Create a for loop to iterate over the first index of the array: ex. change i in array[i][]
2. Create a for loop to iterate over the second index of the array: ex. change i in array[][i]

21) What is a String?
The String class represents character strings. All string literals in Java programs, such as "abc", are implemented as instances of this class.

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
toString()
contains()
indexOf()
isEmpty()
toUpperCase()


23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
Strings are constant. Their values cannot be changed after they are created. i9


24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
javac file_name.java
java file_name [the two parameters]

*file_name.java contains the main method.
