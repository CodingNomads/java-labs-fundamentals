Answer the following questions:

1) What is an array?
It is a set of objects of a particular type

2) What the code required to create (instantiate) a String array with size 10 named "cats"?
String[] cats = new String[10];

3) What is a multidimensional array?
An array of arrays typically represented as a Matrix or cube

4) What is the code required to create (instantiate) a 2-dimensional int array that is 6 high and 6 wide named "scores"?
int[][] scores = new int[6][6];

5) Using code, how do you retrieve a String that is the 10th item in a traditional array named dogs?
dogs[10]

6) What is an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException?
Exception attempting to read from an invalid array index

7) Using one line of code, demonstrate how to retrieve the second to the last item from a int array.
someArray[-2]

8) What is the maximum allowable size of an array in Java?
2147483647

9) What is a bubble sort?
A simple algorithm which looks for the min or max number in an array - not efficient

10) How does a bubble sort work?
It iterates through every element of the array and moves the higher / lower value to one side until  they are all organized

11) When might you use an irregular array? What is a good example of an irregular array?
an array with irregular 'columns' and 'rows'

12) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a for loop.
for (int i = 1; i < userArray.length; i+=2) {
            System.out.print(userArray[i] + ",");
        }


13) Demonstrate how to iterate through an array, printing each value, using a while loop.
int i = 0;
while(i < someArray.length) {
    System.out.println(someArray[i]);
    i++;
}

14) What is a queue?
First in, first last group of objects

15) What are the two primary operations that a queue performs?
add and remove or queue and dequeue

16) What is a stack?
Last in First out group of object

17) What differentiates stacks and queues?
FIFO vs LIFO

18) When would you use an enhanced for loop?
when I need to iterate through every object in an array

19) What is "The Collections Framework"? What classes does it include?
It is a java framework which implements different objects / data structures to organize object - includes stack, queue, linkedlist, etc.

20) How do you iterate over a two-dimensional array? Demonstrate using psuedo code.
int[][] someArray = new int[1][2];
        for (int rowIndex = 0; rowIndex < 5; rowIndex++) {
            System.out.println();
            for (int columnIndex = 0; columnIndex < 10; columnIndex++) {
                System.out.print(someArray[rowIndex][columnIndex] + " ");
            }
        }

21) What is a String?
An object wich leverages chars and methods to build other String objects

22) What are a few common methods for operating on Strings?
length, charAt, hashCode, etc.

23) What does "Strings are immutable" mean?
Strings can NEVER change

24) Using the CLI, how do you invoke a Java application and provide two parameters to the main method?
java app_name param1,param2
