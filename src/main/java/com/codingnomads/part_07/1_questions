1) What is a Java package?

packages are collection of classes.
Related pieces of a program can be grouped together
Classes within a package can be made private, i.e. only classes from within the package can use them. (further enhancing encapsulation)
packages partition the namespace. Large programs might have name collisions. We have a new namespace for each package.

2) What is the CLASSPATH variable all about?

Classpath allows us to set the path to the package if it not stored in a sub-directory of the current working directory

3) What does the package structure mirror?

Directory structure

4 How do packages affect access to Java classes?

classes in a package can only be utilised if the package has been imported.

5) What is an interface?

A list of methods that must be implemented by another class. I.e what must be done, but not how to do it.

6) What makes interfaces unique?

They do not contain any implmentation of the methods contained within them.

7) What keyword is used to specify that a class is going to use a separate interface?

interface

8) What makes interfaces so useful?

multiple implmentations of the same method. Polymorphism.

9) What was added in JDK 8 that makes interfaces even more useful?

The ability to add default implementation behaviour

10) How many interfaces can a single class implement?

as many as desired
