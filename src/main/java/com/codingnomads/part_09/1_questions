1) What is the difference between a byte stream and a character stream?

Byte stream reads/writes byte by byte. Character streams read/write character by character and are useful for text files.

2) List at least 3 examples of byte stream classes?

BufferedInputStream
BufferedOutputStream
ByteArrayInputStream
ByteArrayOutputStream
DataInputStream
DataOutputStream

3) List at least 3 examples of character stream classes?

BufferedReader
BufferedWriter
CharArrayReader
CharArrayWriter
FileReader
FileWriter

4) What is try-with-resources? Why is it super cool?

a code block that automatically intialises a resource upon execution and closes when it leaves teh block.


5) Demonstrate a try-wth-resources block:

try (FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream() FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream()) {
     // code block
     }


6) What does the read() method on the FileInputStream class return?

int

7) What is the documentation above of the FileInputStream class header say? (hint: inside /** ... */)



8) Is a DataOutputStream used for bytes or characters?

Its a byte stream used for outputting Java's primitive types

9) What is a BufferedReader?

Reads text from a character-input stream


10) Why does a BufferedReader require an InputStreamReader as an argument?

Because bufferedreader does not create an I/O connection. A stream is required.

11) What does the InputStreamReader dp with it's byte stream argument?

decodes bytes to characters using specified charset.

12) What is the difference between the read() and readLine() on BufferedReader?

read() reads a single character.
readline() reads a entire line of text

13) Demonstrate instantiating a BufferedReader that will read a file called "yucatan_cenotes.txt"

try (BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("some/path/yucatan_cenotes.txt")) {
    // code here
    }
