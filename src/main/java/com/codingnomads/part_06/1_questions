1) What is Java inheritance?
Inheritance allows a subclass to add (extend) a superclass when it is declared.
This means that a subclass inherits all the fields and methods from a superclass.

2) How does inheritance work?
Place the keyword "extends" after the class name

3) What are some advantages that inheritance provides?
1. there is no limit to how many levels of inheritance you can create
2. a subclass can have direct access to all public and protected members of all parent classes

4) What does the "super" keyword do?
The "super" keyword is used to refer to a variable or method in the parent class.

5) In what order are constructors called when there are multiple subclasses?
its from inner to outer:
A extends B extends C
first constructor would be C, then B then A

6) What does it mean when a method is overridden?
A method is overriden when a child class declares a method with the same exact return type, name and parameters,
but with different arguments.

7) How do overridden methods support polymorphism?
A parent class can define a method, and a child class can override the behavior of the parent class, thereby using the same method in different ways ("poly" - multiple forms).

8) What is the difference between an overloaded method and an overridden method?
Overloading occurs when two or more methods in one class have the same method name but different parameters.
Overriding means having two methods with the same method name and parameters.
One of these methods is in the parent class and the other is in the child class.

9) What is dynamic method dispatch?
Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overriden method is resolved at run time rather than compile time.
This is important because this is how Java implements run-time polymorphism.

10) What does the "final" keyword do?
variables with the final keyword do not change.

11) Are classes in Java are a subclass of what super class?
Object
